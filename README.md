**Introduction -**


This is a puzzle game i made for project 1 of my General Assembly Web Development Immersive course.
Made after only 1 week of javascript, the aim of the game is to get the bug to the end of the maze.

**Concept -**


 It is a top down puzzle game based on a grid of tiles. you move the bug with the arrow keys and collect pick ups; gems and extra lives.

**Technologies used -**
 

* Javascript
* CSS
* Photoshop CC

**What went well -**
I really enjoyed learning how to use tilesets create animations and a map that can be programs to change easily level to level. 

**Challenges -**
One of the biggest challenges i found was getting the bug to face the correct way when moving around. I solved this by having the previous move the bug had made stored, and then compare it to the current square. Thus giving me the correct reference to make him face the correct way.

**Future Features -**
I would love to revisit this game in the future, perhaps when i have more javascript experience under my belt. Building a level creator would make development of the game easier. It needs a lot of testing to create a progression of hardness throughout the puzzles, and build in features gradually so it isnt confusing for the player.

**Final thoughts -**
Really enjoyed making this project. It has always been a dream of mine to create a game, and i think for a first game this turned out well. I found inspiration in old windows games, and i feel that comes out in the final game.
